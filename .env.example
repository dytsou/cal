# Cloudflare Worker URL (optional)
# If using a Cloudflare Worker, set this to your worker URL
# Example: https://cal-proxy.yourdomain.com
# If not set, defaults to https://open-web-calendar.hosted.quelltext.eu
WORKER_URL=

# NOTE: CALENDAR_URL is now managed via Cloudflare Worker secrets
# 
# To set up calendar URLs:
# 1. Set CALENDAR_URL secret in your Cloudflare Worker:
#    wrangler secret put CALENDAR_URL
# 
# 2. Provide comma-separated calendar URLs (can be plain or fernet:// encrypted):
#    https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/example%40gmail.com/public/basic.ics,https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/another%40gmail.com/public/basic.ics
# 
# 3. Set ENCRYPTION_KEY secret in your Cloudflare Worker (if using fernet:// URLs):
#    wrangler secret put ENCRYPTION_KEY
# 
# See README.md for detailed setup instructions.
